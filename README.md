# SiemensFacaplate
in this repo, I will upload Faceplates that I have designed and used in real projects

Transmitter Faceplate:

The designed faceplate will show the value of the variable while showing the HH, H, L, and LL alarm state, and the ability to configure the Zero/Span and alarm values. in addition, The operator can calibrate a value that ignores the real value and assumes the desired value as input.
Using the button in the corner right below the faceplate, the operator can switch between Normal and Tuning Mode.
PV: Process Value
HH: HighHigh Switch Value
PH: High Switch Value
PL: Low Switch Value
LL: LowLow Switch Value
If the process Value reaches every switch value, the H, HH, L, and LL text will appear in the Faceplate.

The operator can calibrate the transmitter using the Cal button to a specified value.

Pump/Motor Faceplate:

The above faceplate is designed to control a pump and monitor its state.
the black space in the faceplate shows the status of the Pump: Start, Stop, and Fault(Electrical).
The start and Stop buttons will Energize or de-energize the Pump while the ribbon above the Start button will show the status of the Start action.


PID Faceplate:

in the PID faceplate user can read PV, SV, MV, and the status of loop(Man/Auto). The status of the loop can change using the button below the faceplate and the PID coefficients can be changed in tuning mode while a trend will show PV, MV, and SV values.
